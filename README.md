### Data Analysis Project


## Profitable App Profiles For The App Store and Google Play Markets.

My objective is to find the mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play Markets. I am working as a data analyst for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps and my task is to enable our team of developers to make decisions on what apps to develop the types of apps that are likely to attract more users.

The company's main source of revenue is the in-apps ads hence the revenue is mostly influenced by the number of users who use its apps. My goal isto analyze the data to help the developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.
